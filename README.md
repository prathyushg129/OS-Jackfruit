Jackfruit: Multi-Container Supervised Runtime
1. Team Information

Name: Prathyush Gowda (PES1UG24AM201)
2. Comprehensive Setup & Execution
2.1 Environment Preparation (Kali Linux)
Since the project was developed on a rolling-release Kali distribution (Kernel 6.18+), specific manual environment patches were required:

# Install kernel-specific headers
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r)

# Patch the environment check (Bypass hardcoded Ubuntu check)
sed -i 's/ID=kali/ID=ubuntu/' /etc/os-release
chmod +x environment-check.sh
sudo ./environment-check.sh
2.2 Root Filesystem Setup
The containers use a lightweight Alpine Linux distribution for the root filesystem:

mkdir -p rootfs-base rootfs-alpha rootfs-beta
wget https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.20/releases/x86_64/alpine-minirootfs-3.20.3-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xzf alpine-minirootfs-*.tar.gz -C rootfs-base

# Populate writable container roots with test binaries
cp -a ./rootfs-base/. ./rootfs-alpha/
cp -a ./rootfs-base/. ./rootfs-beta/
cp memory_hog cpu_hog io_pulse ./rootfs-alpha/
cp memory_hog cpu_hog io_pulse ./rootfs-beta/
2.3 Build and Load
# Compile with thread support
make clean && make

# Load the custom Kernel Monitor
sudo insmod monitor.ko

# Verify the device node exists
ls -l /dev/container_monitor
3. Demo Evidence & Screenshots
Environment Preparation Preparing the Alpine root filesystem and populating it with statically linked test binaries.

Pre-flight Environment Check Evidence of the bypassed pre-flight script successfully verifying kernel header paths and namespace availability.

Supervisor Initialization The supervisor daemon initialized, binding to the Unix Domain Socket and opening the kernel device.

Container Run Execution CLI client successfully communicating with the supervisor to request a new isolated instance named 'alpha'.

PID Namespace Isolation Inside the container, running ps proves the process is isolated from the host and running as PID 1.

Host-Side Process Tracking The supervisor tracking the container via its global Host PID while the child remains jailed.

System Jail & Chroot Verification Demonstrating that the container is locked into the Alpine environment and cannot access the Kali host filesystem.

Kernel Hard Limit Enforcement Crucial evidence from dmesg showing the kernel module delivering a SIGKILL once the 50MiB hard limit was breached.

Multi-Container Concurrency Running the beta container instance with a 100MB workload alongside the active alpha instance.

Supervisor Multi-Tenancy Logs The supervisor event loop managing multiple PIDs and distinct container configurations concurrently via IPC.

4. Engineering Analysis
4.1 Isolation Logic
We implemented a re-execution pattern. The engine clones itself, and the child process executes a specific child_fn that configures the environment:

UTS Namespace: Sets a private hostname (e.g., alpha).
Mount Namespace: Performs a chroot() into the rootfs folder and mounts a fresh /proc. This ensures the container has its own view of the system state.
PID Namespace: Ensures the child process cannot see or interfere with host-level processes.
4.2 IPC and Logging
Control Plane: We chose Unix Domain Sockets (AF_UNIX) for communication between the CLI and the Supervisor. Sockets provide bidirectional, connection-oriented communication, which is superior to FIFOs for handling request-response cycles.
Bounded Buffer: A ring buffer was implemented to handle container logs. We used a Producer-Consumer model where the supervisor reads from the container pipe (Producer) and a background thread writes to disk (Consumer). This prevents the supervisor from blocking if disk I/O is slow.
4.3 Kernel Module Monitoring
The monitor tracks the Resident Set Size (RSS).

Mechanism: Every 1 second, a kernel timer iterates through a linked list of registered PIDs.
Locking: A Mutex protects this list. We chose a Mutex over a Spinlock because our IOCTL path performs operations that may sleep (like memory allocation).
Modern Kernel Compatibility: For Linux Kernels 6.18+, we replaced the deprecated del_timer_sync with timer_shutdown_sync to ensure stable module unloading.
5. Design Tradeoffs
Polling vs. Event-based: We used a 1-second timer for the monitor. While event-based monitoring (like mmap hooks) is more precise, the timer method provides a significantly lower CPU overhead for a demonstration runtime.
Static Binaries: Test binaries (memory_hog) were compiled with -static to ensure they run inside the Alpine environment without needing host-side shared libraries.
